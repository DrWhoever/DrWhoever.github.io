 		<h2>This is my first blog</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
	**Thunder**. For a moment I’m frozen in time. One more time I listen to the sound of rain drops, falling on the leaves, bushes, grass and the ground all around me. I feel it flow from the top of my head, down my face, arms and legs and finally into my shoes. My clothes gradually get drenched. I wipe off rainwater from my eyes, and for a moment catch a glimpse of the muddy terrain before me. At the center of it all, the love of my life is holding a gun to my face some five meters off. Her face… nothing more than a mixed reaction of anger and heart-wrenching sorrow.</p>
	<p> “I’m Sorry…”, she exhales as she fixes her grip firmly on the 1911 pistol once more ready to take the shot. A bright light from the sky fills all around us and in the moment my mind is taken aback. Back to the day I set my eyes on her for the first time. Such a beautiful creature. She was sitting by herself in a restaurant on a Saturday evening. Considering women her age who at this time of night would be out making merry and ‘living life to the fullest’, this was a rather curious sight in this age of confused existentialism. I remember how I just sat there for what I would describe as the longest three minutes of my life. You know, that gut instinct you get the moment you think you’ve met the one? that feeling that makes you pay attention to the details: How she moves, how she’s constantly face down looking at her phone, how she wears a huge hoodie that covers all her upper body except for her face and hands, how she sips her tea, how she crosses her legs underneath the table. It’s all butterflies and sunshine until she notices you staring at her, giving you ‘the death stare’ (cue the crippling anxiety).</p>
	<p> I don’t know what you make of life but for me considering how small I am in an infinite universe, all the tiny infinite number of events that led to that exact moment is proof enough that life wanted me to meet her (Excuse me for my naivety). </p>
	<p>Sprezzatura. As the Italians call it. I tore a piece of paper from my notebook, wrote it down, folded it into an origami of Pikachu and gave it to the barrister who handed it to her in classy fashion. Now it was all a matter of time. She opened it, stared at it for a second and looked at me, giving me an unexpected warm smile, she took out a pen, scribbled something on the paper, looked at me one more time (as if to watch my reaction) before getting up and leaving. Boys will be boys. She… moved, in a really graceful manner as she walked towards the exit (At least that’s what my conscious mind saw), giving me one last look followed by a wink and a smile before disappearing out the doors.</p>
	<p>No sooner had she walked out than I sprung to where she was seated. There it was, the piece of paper. It lay there on the table with her almost empty coffee mug placed on one of the corners to hold it in place. Right below the word ‘Sprezzatura’ were the words, ‘Good style’ with her phone number next to it. Yeah!  I rushed outside the doors after her, only to find she was already gone. I smiled. Took one last look at the piece of paper, and finally walked back inside the restaurant.</p>
	<p>Snap out of it! The roar of thunder brought me back to my senses, making me realize my time was not over yet. There she was, searching frantically in the mud for something. This was my chance! Or, at least until the next lightning flashes… Sirens could now be heard closing in on our location. It was now a game of time. What will I do?</p>
	<p>She found the gun, picked it up and pointed it at me once more, ready to take the shot. I lifted up my hands as a hostage would do before saying in a terse voice.  ”Let’s get this over with”. The police were almost at the scene. You could hear their voices and canine units rush through the forest with their flashlights. She knew she had nothing to lose.</p>
	<p> Click!... click! click! “If you are going to come after me, make sure you finish the job on time”, I said as I dropped the magazines with live rounds on the muddy ground. Her face was filled with morbid disbelief looking at me as the police’s flashlight slowly rested on her head before… Bang!</p>
	<p>No amount of planning or preparation can ever prepare a person for such a moment. I don’t know which one hits you harder, the bullet going through her head or the look in her eye as the life slips away from her falling body. To this day, I keep a small photo of the two of us from our date to the museum in my wallet. A constant reminder I take with me everywhere that this kind of life is not meant for everybody…</p>

 		<h2>This is my second blog</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
	Have you ever asked yourself the question “Why am I the way I am?”. Or maybe found yourself blurting out only to feel regret later on? Have you ever thought up scenarios in your brain that hurt you? And if that’s not enough, even go on ahead obsess over them? Well. The good news is, your human. Bad news is, as a psychiatrist would put, you probably suffer from OCD. You probably didn’t come here for a lecture or a scolding, but who knows, ‘the cave you fear entering most may have the answers you’ve been looking for all along.</p>
	<p>Growing up in an African home, I’ve always wondered what life is. I asked all those who I know that came before me, but, no one really knows why we are all here. All I know is we’ve been brought up with all these expectations: conquer the world, decorate yourself with medals, show them how talented and/or smart you are and one day, all your dreams will come true. Well. It’s all fucking sunshine and flowers until one day… bang! </p>
	<p>Life comes along and knocks you across your face so bad you’re left on the ground wondering “where did I go wrong?” “why do bad things happen to good people?” Everything starts falling apart and you feel like you’re losing control like water through the palm of your hand. Everyone starts walking out of your life and you’re left alone to wonder what’s wrong with you. “Am I even human, possibly?”</p>
	<p>Life starts seeming like a cruel joke the more you think about it. You start “experimenting” new chemicals that keep away the demons that keep you up at 3 am, only to realize you have a commitment at 8am when sleep finally comes in! Sucks, doesn’t it?</p>
	<p>Thing is, there is something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everyone. Maybe it’s stems from an abusive childhood, neglect from a caregiver, trauma from the loss of a loved one. Whatever it is, only you can find it, even if you don’t know what it is. I always wondered why kings with all their power (especially the wise ones) always sat on a throne when they weren’t out doing… “kingly stuff” until I came to realize it was a point of reflection.</p>
	<p>Basically, the answers to all the questions we usually ask all lie within us. But sadly, due to generations of conditioning, we’ve been made to believe in what we are told, even if we know it’s not what we really want in life. To be able to look at yourself in the mirror and accept what you see has to be the highest level of bravery in the 21st century. If you probably meditate, then you probably know what the phrase “we are all one” or “we are infinite” mean. That fear you feel, the fear of what you can explain, that’s what keeps you from doing anything worthwhile, sorry to say. There’s literally no difference between you and Elon Musk, only the power of will.</p>
	<p>If you live life expecting to be in control of everything, or rather, expecting everything to be in a logical sense, you’ll probably feel lost when it comes to understanding who you are. Some call it the soul, others consciousness, the psyche. I don’t know what you prefer but we all search for a higher consciousness, a state of zen or even righteousness. Recent discoveries in quantum mechanics (If you have time, you can read about the Large Hadron Collider, in CERN, Switzerland. And the plans to build an even newer and larger collider) show us that nothing can really make sense without consciousness. (Hello… are you still up?) Schrodinger’s cat shows us that we don’t really know anything for sure. I mean, no one really knows what life is, the only important aspect being to preserve it. Yes. We are all important. We are all part of a collective consciousness.</p>
	<p>8 billion people. All unique life experiences, recorded in something really important: memory. Man, as Alan Watt’s said, is considered a time binding animal. Basically, we have the ability to look forward into the future and plan for our lives or even predict events based on past experiences or even stories told to us by others: a really important tool for our survival.</p>
	<p>Be careful how you use this ability. Man is a creature which I like to call, a combination of primal animal and mad god. (My apologies to those of you with rigid beliefs) It’s okay to not be sure about everything. Even the greatest answer to most questions in science is simply, I don’t know. We don’t know where we come from. What our true purpose is. Life has no meaning except for what we make of it. If you need proof of this, look at where we came from. Survival in the savannah plains of Africa to monumental civilizations with enough power to end all life on this planet in a matter of minutes.</p>
	<p>Whatever we are, we don’t really know. And that’s okay, it just shows you how large a playground you have to explore. Enjoy all the time you’ve got. You will never get it back. Listen to music you love, make art, travel the world. Whatever it is, just do it. We are the caretakers of all of creation. The observers of the wonder of everything and still the same ones to make sense out of all which makes no sense. If you consider all events that led to you being born in a universe this large, there is literally no reason to be afraid of the unknown. I hope your brain is still okay after all this. Go be remarkable!</p>

 		<h2>This is my third blog</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
	6:38 am. 55 meters above the ground. Temperatures are probably around 16 degrees. I’m seated on a rail running along the building’s rooftop perimeter. The sun is just about to rise. Must be my lucky day. During this time of year, the conditions are just right for one of the most beautiful sunrises for the year. I think it’s sad that probably only a few locals will experience this phenomenon in their lifetime. The sun just starts to peek over the horizon, with its slow but rather noticeable movement upwards. Its rays running almost parallel to the ground, pear through the fog just the right amount to expose mount Kenya’s outline to my left …plus I know it’s a beautiful feeling, in oblivion yeah, yeah... Such a beautiful day. A beautiful day to give a man a proper sendoff…</p>
	<p>With one quick look through binoculars, I jump to position to wait for the target to get into position. I flick open the scope covers and line up the crosshairs with his bathroom window. For a moment, I stop the scope at his daughter’s bedroom. There she is. Comfortably sleeping clutching on to what I assume was her favorite doll. I freeze. Funny thing about power. We always want it until we actually do get it. But none hits you more than the power to decide who lives and who dies. I wonder if this is God’s greatest dilemma.</p>
	<p>The contract was clear: go in undetected, neutralize the target at any cost including any witnesses. The price on his head was unusually high for a man who lived a fairly normal life. On his driveway was a parked Nissan Xtrail. Shoot first, ask questions later they say. I am no soldier. This is espionage.</p>
	<p>6:40 am. The alarm goes of next to me and the man gets up as well on time to go for… well, what all men do when they wake up. I swing back the scope and rest the crosshairs over my target. All I have to do is wait.</p>
	<p>Nothing pulls you into the moment more than the last few moments before life ends. For a moment, your senses heighten. Everything becomes vivid. The chirping birds, the blowing wind, they all dim. Your heart beat gets louder. You can feel your pupils dilate as you try to focus on your target’s immediate surrounding, ensuring and hoping that everything goes to plan. It’s almost as if time slows down. He stops along the corridor. Shit! There was no time. His wife would soon wake up to go prepare breakfast. I have to take the shot! He seems to be mesmerized by his sleeping daughter. Love.</p>
	<p>I remember the first time I took a human life. It was during my days in the military. I was under my mentor, known to me only as Mega. Really mysterious fellow. No one knew his backstory. Everything about him was redacted. I once heard a rumor he wiped out an entire village. A village which stands today as a ghost town. He was a moderately built fellow. Very tall, brown skin and covered with hair like a sailor. He didn’t say much. Only spoke when he saw necessary. A trait that made me admire him as a master assassin.</p>
	<p>“The mark of a true assassin is to leave the environment around the target completely unchanged as possible. It’s almost as if a ghost simply… claimed… the victim” I remember these words vividly as if I’m back in Somalia lying flat on a dry, dusty ground waiting for a kill confirmation on a wanted human trafficker who had a bounty over his head in more than five countries. I remember how scared I was. How my fingers trembled over the rifle as my mentor calmed me down in his usual stoic way. “Calm down. Clear your mind” for a moment I take a deep breath and enter the flow state, pointing the crosshairs at the target. “Let go of anything and everything you feel attached to” My finger clenched more tightly on the trigger. My weapon of choice? a 50caliber sniper rifle. (I never take any chances) “Pull”</p>
	<p>“Bang” with a thunderous explosion the bullet flies off leaving behind a trail of smoke. I feel the Rifle press against my shoulder from recoil. I return back to the present and find my finger pressed on the trigger. I take one more look through the scope. “Kill confirmed”. “Good job, Ghost. Report back for your next assignment…”</p>

    I look at myself inside a mirror,</p>

 		<h2>This is my sixth blog</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
	Silence. Feels more like noise. I can hear the bulb buzz. The dripping of water from the tap is annoying. I can’t help but sit still and notice how tonight: no song is worth playing, no sleep is worth sleeping, no book is worth reading, no show is worth watching. Not even food can fix this feeling. It’s like I’m stuck in this position though I know I can still move. I feel a chill. Not the kind from an open window but one from within. It’s leaving a heavy load on my chest. I’m afraid. Not of anything in the world but from inside. What it is, I don’t know.</p>
	<p> It’s like a shadow. Always tailing me in the sun. It’s like the boogie man under the bend that didn’t want to let you sleep at night. What I see doesn’t more of scare me but instead feels me with surprise in the clarity of my mind just how I haven’t been doing anything worthwhile with my life. I see how selfish I have been, how jealous I have been, how lazy I have been, how lustful I have been; The list goes on. “I hate myself”. I look at everything around me and start thinking about just how I don’t deserve any of it. Not even the least of it. I think about how many chances I let fly by me. I think of all the times I could have reached out to someone who needed me. Even the opportunities I looked down upon could have actually made me a better person than I am right now. I think about all the times I lied just to uphold a reputation that I didn’t have. I remember all the times I ignored helping someone due to my own problems. I remember it all. It’s filling me with a feeling I don’t really like that makes me feel I don’t deserve to even be alive. I get up. Almost certain I look like someone who knows what to do. I walk up the stairs to the roof. When I get up there, the first thing I notice is how cold it is at night. I climb up to the highest point (Funny thing about that, I’d normally be afraid.) and sit. I just look into the distance. The starry night. I don’t mean the sky, but the many buildings with their bright lights below me. The sky is dark. The stars are barely visible. No cloud in sight. I’m starting to calm down. My mind bears not even a single thought. All the noise is gone. Something about tonight feels different. I look out into the distance once more, thinking about all those eight billion people alive at this very same moment. Matter of fact, just how many organisms are alive at this very same moment. Including you. Including me. Among all those other eight billion people, each of them having a boogie man of their own. Life sucks. No one really is who they want to be and no one ever really will. When you think about it, it’s like a cruel joke. You’re first of all called into existence without even being asked, and you don’t even have the most remote idea of why you are here or even at least a reset button that can take you back to who you really are. I realize just how meaningless life really is. That grudge you hold on someone, that revenge plot you have waiting to deploy, that “I’ll show you all…” that is like a 1ton rock on your back inflicted on you by yourself. You think of ways to better your life by maybe turning to religion; but we know how that worked last time, don’t we? Maybe change my crew and get new friends but I still won’t feel like I fit in. I’d try to join a club but I don’t feel like that’s what I want to do. But, what do I want to do? Who even does? Albert Einstein once said “My only talent is that I’m exceptionally curious” (at least I think that’s what he said). Life feels more like a passing phase. It’s like, you’re dropped off here from wherever it is you came from, go through the hardest trials, desperately chasing earthly possessions and things we are dearly attached to. It’s like a funny game of letting go and holding on tight and you have to figure out how to be good at it or maybe instead I don’t know, eat shit! There is no manual or rule book to this game, only the outcomes of the stories of those who came before us and have what we currently view of as “The perfect life”. This can be: the perfect body, the perfect love life, the perfect career, the perfect car or that top CEO position so that you can tell everyone else, “I told you”. An old Buddhist priestess once said “You can never really be wiser until you actually give it a try” So don’t hate on that person who’s trying to find themselves, you’re in it too. “Meaning is a jumper you have to knit yourself”. Everybody has to be conscious about themselves at some point. Therefore, you also must be ready, for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect. Or as Albeit Einstein also said, “All time, affects all the time, all the time”. It’s all the same. Ever wonder why you aren’t happy with anyone? (This question goes strongly to both genders, by the way), why you are satisfied with what you are getting, why you are so stressed and anxious all the time. Like when someone tells you something, it’s almost as if you’ll die if you don’t return answer. It’s like you’ll also die if the attention doesn’t keep coming in. the truth is, the world doesn’t care, it never has. If there is a God, at the end of all this, he won’t ask you “Why didn’t you live like…?” (I hope you know the rest of this story. You do? That’s great! Moving along.) Live your life the way you want to. At the end of it all, only you will love yourself or hate yourself, no one else will. You will want to go back and do everything differently, but you won’t be able to. You will only regret what you didn’t go for when the consciousness starts slipping away from your body. That person you didn’t talk to on the matatu simply because, ‘what will people say?’ (though I don’t mean anyone. Be smart). That person who’s been checking up on your regardless of how you shut them away (Again. Be aware of manipulators. They seem pretty sweet but bite worse than a puff adder). Everything is all in your head. Who knows? Maybe your blue is my red. A youtuber who I liked once said “You’ve always had the blueprint to build heaven, but even if we give you know, you will only build hell.” It’s okay to not be right, it’s all conditioning, much like so a dog is trained to fetch. But what do I know? To be wrong is death. Even evolution proves it. But concerning our structure and how it sustains intelligent life, is a true miracle. A fully functional body that enables you to do…well, all humanly things. It’s like the point of fusion of animal and mad god (Again. Apologies to those with fixed beliefs.) I know my capabilities, and I love them all. I also know my weaknesses, and I use them as points of improvement. Bringing you back to the idea of all living beings on earth, imagine all that is on a spec of dust, floating in an infinite universe with infinite worlds, some defying even logic. For you to instantly say we are alone, consider an ant, what does it know about the cities you live in? Baby steps. Maybe on other worlds exists life, who knows? Mars once had oceans on its surface but barely stands with an atmosphere today. You are on a planet still in her prime and you can still complain about your feet being cold. Baby steps. It’s almost like God split himself apart during creation into different infinite beings all experiencing their own unique versions of reality all at the same time. Trying to reconnect himself back into one through love. All being a part of one collective consciousness. Instead of feeling mediocre, Love yourself. Love yourself in the way that even your own mother and father failed at your infancy, all because they were distracted by their own problems. Perhaps instead of always being right and blowing the world in nukes, maybe we can provide an alternative solution; Neither wrong nor right. One that tries to understands everyone’s point of view. (are you thinking about love? of course you are.) instead of worrying about what you will eat tomorrow, why not enjoy the now? The curious child in you who always wondered about the beauty of the world: Or maybe we try a Mad Max kind of world? Enjoy the roller coaster ride, cherish the peaks of love and happiness, and also remember there will be drops characterized by tears down the road. Life is… life. To me, it’s the only English word without a meaning, because everyone experiences their own unique version of it.  This piece of writing is like a time capsule left for anyone who may stumble upon it at any point in history, a reminder that you are not alone in this. Thank you all for helping me grow…</p>
 	<p>It’s getting late. I get up and almost in a similar manner, walk back down to my room. Perhaps tomorrow I’ll get started on that project I’ve been meaning to start. Perhaps I’ll start even now. That’s where the answer lies…</p>
